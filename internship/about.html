<h2>Who We Are</h2>

This website is created by Thushar, Tvisha Prakash, Vaishnavi Shet, Vandana Prabhu and Varun Tejpal Puthran. We are the students of
NMAM Institute of technology. Currently pursuing B.E in Computer Science Engineering, we are
passionate about building new pathways to help people around us. This is a small-scale website
aiming at students of Indian nationality and specifically Karnataka students. We are
currently based in Nitte, Karnataka, India. <br>
<h2>Vision:</h2> 
We as future engineers believe there is a solution to every problem. Our country is a developing
country and education is a powerful resource to power this growth. Financial aids accelerate and
motivate students to pursue further education. To make sure this medium is used to its full
potential, we want to use our resources and technical knowledge to promote it. We believe that
every person deserves a chance to grow; hence creating this project is an attempt to contribute to
the society. <br>
<h2>Aim:</h2>
Our aim is to help bridge the financial gap found in academic sector. Our website is free and open
for all those who are looking for scholarships that are applicable to them. Plenty of scholarships by
various organizations go unnoticed due to lack of information and awareness amongst the people.
Through our webpage, with one click you can retrieve all the information required for the
scholarship that is applicable to you. Our product aims at creating a hassle-free and fruitful
experience for the user. <br>
<h2>Privacy and Security:</h2>
In this new age of internet, many customers are prone to hacking and websites illegally selling
customer data. We as creators have made sure that neither of the both takes place. The users need
not worry about data manipulation or privacy issues. So we do not ask our users to share their contact details like
email address or phone numbers that may leak any kind of private information. Even, the details
asked to filter out the applicable scholarship are not disclosed to anyone. Thus ensuring a safety net
and protecting consumers from the above mentioned problems. <br><br><br>
